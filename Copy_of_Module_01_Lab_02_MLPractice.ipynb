        "1) Yes, averaging the validation accuracy across multiple splits, often referred to as cross-validation, can indeed provide more consistent and reliable results compared to a single validation split.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits through techniques like k-fold, cross-validation provides a more accurate estimate of how the model is likely to perform on the test set. While it doesn't directly estimate the test accuracy, it serves as a better proxy for it compared to a single validation split.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) The step size and number of iterations that we specify in the model affect the speed and accuracy. If we decrease the step size or increase the number of iterations, the results are more accurate, but the simulation runs slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) While increasing the number of iterations in cross-validation can help when dealing with a small dataset, it has limitations and might not fully address the challenges associated with extremely small training or validation datasets."
